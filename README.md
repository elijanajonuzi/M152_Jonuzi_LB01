# Kinophil - LB02 Modul 152

Kinophil is a website where the costumer of a Cinema can see the weekly programm. 
He can also reserve a seat for a selected film. 
This selection happens in a 3D view. 
The costumer can click on a specific seat and the view will be moved to the seat. 
This way he can imagine better how the visual to watch the film will be. 

Nice to have: Home page with a carousel with all the news.
